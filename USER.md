# USER.md

Target user profile (current): internal trial for investigators.

## Preferences

- Prefer "just execute" over long back-and-forth; minimize interruptions.
- Windows is primary host; macOS is also supported.
- Mobile acquisition: best effort, but do not implement bypass/cracking. If not authorized/available, record precheck as skipped with reasons.

## Output Expectations

- Keep `TODOLIST.md` updated with status and verification notes.
- Maintain `测试报告.md` to cover all major scenarios.
