# 2026-02-14

## Snapshot

- Updated `TODOLIST.md` status: P0/P1 mostly complete; P2 remains (desktop shell, signing/release, E2E).
- Current desktop entry (`cmd/inspector-desktop`) is a launcher: starts webapp and opens system browser (not an embedded webview).
- Windows native installer uses Inno Setup script (`installer/windows/crypto-trace-inspector.iss`), but needs Windows/CI to build and validate.

## Notes

- Keep repository-level onboarding instructions in `AGENTS.md`, and long-term decisions in `MEMORY.md`.
- Do not put secrets/personal data into Git.
