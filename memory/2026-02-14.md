# 2026-02-14

## Snapshot

- Updated `TODOLIST.md` status: P0/P1 mostly complete; P2 remains (desktop shell, signing/release, E2E).
- Current desktop entry (`cmd/inspector-desktop`) is a launcher: starts webapp and opens system browser (not an embedded webview).
- Windows native installer uses Inno Setup script (`installer/windows/crypto-trace-inspector.iss`), but needs Windows/CI to build and validate.

## Notes

- Keep repository-level onboarding instructions in `AGENTS.md`, and long-term decisions in `MEMORY.md`.
- Do not put secrets/personal data into Git.

## Updates (late)

- Added Playwright E2E smoke test (create case -> host scan -> export forensic zip -> verify) under `e2e/` and runner `scripts/e2e.sh`.
- `cmd/inspector-desktop` now supports `--ui browser|webview|none`; macOS installers/bundle default to `--ui webview` for a true desktop window.
- CI: `build-installers` now creates a GitHub Release for `v*` tags and uploads installers + `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- CI (Windows): added installer smoke test (silent install -> run `inspector-desktop --ui none` -> `/api/health` -> uninstall) via `scripts/windows/installer_smoke_test.ps1`.
